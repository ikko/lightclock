    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>LightClock° is a 21st century think tank. We’re based in London.</h3>
    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>A “light clock” is a thought experiment Einstein used to explain his general theory of relativity, more precisely time dilation: Imagine a light beam -or photon- bouncing between two mirrors in perfect opposition. But what happens if we start moving the clocks? Suddenly the beams bounce in zigzags; their opposition was an illusion of a static state.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="wrapper-work">
      <p>We borrow Einstein’s image as metaphor and invite thinkers from various disciplines of analysis -political science and economics, STEM and law, cultural criticism and education, as well as historians and sociologists, futurists and activists etc.- to apply to the LightClock° thinker pool.</p>
      <p>LightClock° thinkers work in international opponent duos so that they arrive at stimulatingly negotiated and mutually agreed on solutions.</p>
      <p>When LightClock° are approached by a client - and NGO, a political organisation, a marketing agency etc. - we notify our thinker pool of the opportunity.</p>
      <p>LightClock° thinkers can undertake such paid research work in duos. You can bring a writing partner from your own networks (personal, Academia.edu, ResearchGate etc.) as long as your partner is coming from different disciplines / leanings / backgrounds etc. or, alternatively, you can find such a partner in the LightClock° thinker pool.</p>
      <p>Our think tank will facilitate the partner search via comprehensive thinker profiles, email alerts and personal reach-out, plus a simple, optional algorithm-based app you can use to match you with a very different thinker you wouldn’t otherwise think of, but with whom you would still enjoy working.</p>
      <p>While a duo works on their assignment, LightClock° provide support, management, mediation, editing, and, at the end, publication to our thinkers, as well as client and account services.</p>
